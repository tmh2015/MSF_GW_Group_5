#Github User Guide:

#1. Link Github and R Studio

Step 1: Fork my repository (https://github.com/YerikZ/MSF_GW_Group_5) 
everyone has done so

Step 2: Create version-control project with the link that appears on YOUR Github repository

Step 3: Different commands

-Pull request: download all the data from Github

-Commit: any change in the project folder (you can find the directory on the bottom left of R Studio)

-Push request: after you commit every modification, you can upload the project folder to the Github repository



#2. Merge Yerik's repository with Yours

Now my repository is the Master, main project repository; all final project related documents should appear here

Simply create a Pull request on Github:

Case 1: Contribute your repository to mine

Select base "name of my repository" to head "name of your repository" 

Note: after I approve the request, your contribution will appear on my repository

Case 2: Synchronise from my repository to yours

Select base "name of your repository" to head "name of my repository"

Note: if there is no conflict, the merge should be automatic

Now you can try Case 2 to obtain the newly updated files from my repository (you can also try to correct errors like typos in this user guide)
