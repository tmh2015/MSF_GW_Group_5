National sample: N=2,142

***Note: The WEIGHT variable is weighting variable intended for use on all questions.

***Note for variables: Race of the respondent "Race1" allows multiple responses, 
and "racecmb" in the dataset combines different responses to the race questions.
The combined variable “racethn” identifies the respondent’s race and ethnicity. 


******************************************************************************************************************************************

The Pew Research Center uses respondents’ self-reported zip code as the basis for geographic variables such as 
region,state and county. We continue to include the original sample geographic variables in the datasets 
(these variables are preceded by an ‘s’) for archival purposes only.

To protect the privacy of respondents, telephone numbers, zip code and other identifying variables have been 
removed from the public data file.

Some special technical variables were also removed, but are available upon request.
